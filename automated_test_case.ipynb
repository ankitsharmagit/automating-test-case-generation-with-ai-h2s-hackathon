      "2. IT developers and IT consultants often ask for an exemplary requirements specification as a starting point in their own project. This document is such a specification. It is a template filled out with a complex example: Requirements for an Electronic Health Record system (EHR). Only a few points had to be illustrated with examples from other areas. Large parts of the specification may be reused in other projects. Parts that are too special for reuse are shown in blue.\n",
      "3. All the requirements are written in tables. Column 1 is the customer's demands. Column 2 is his example solution and later the supplier's proposed solution. There is a contract that matches the requirements. Requirements template, contract, requirements and supplier‚Äôs proposal for real projects are available here: http://www.itu.dk/people/slauesen/SorenReqs.html#SL-07\n",
      "4. You may freely use the template as long as the source and copyright notice are clearly stated, for instance as in the footer of the next page. Copy this document, delete the first page, and adjust the rest to your project. Blue parts should always be replaced with something else - or deleted. Parts with yellow background are warnings or alternatives. Other parts may often be reused. The guide to the template and the contract are published as a booklet:\n",
